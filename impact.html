            <p>Even after samurai were abolished they had an impact on Japan that has carried on throughout its history.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>After the Meiji restoration the "Shinto was made the state religion of Japan" and the moral code it followed was Bushido(6).</li>
                <li>Much of Japan's present day society live their lives in a way following Bushido</li>
                <li>After samurai were abolished, the former warriors had to pick up normal careers. 
                    Some went into other positions of power, "many of the samurai would enter the elite ranks 
                    of politics and industry in modern Japan"(6). </li>
                <li>During World War II " Japanese soldiers brought antique samurai swords into battle and made suicidal “banzai” attacks according to the bushido principle of death before dishonor or defeat"</li>
                <li>Zen gardens were created during the era of the samurai as a result of them adopting Zen Buddhism</li>
                <li>Tea ceremonies are still commonly performed in Japanese culture.</li>
        
            </ul>
            <p>Although samurai are no longer around their influence still shows itself in Japan today. The people of Japan live in honorable ways just like the ancient warriors.</p>
