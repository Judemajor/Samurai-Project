            <p>Samurai were also known as bushi. They led their lives according to their law of ethics, called the code of bushido.
                The bushido code or "the way of the warrior" "stressed concepts such as loyalty to one's master, self discipline and respectful, ethical behavior." (1)
                Samurai served as retainers for feudal lords ("daimyo") and swore loyalty to them. There were different kinds of samurai throughout their history.
                There were women samurai warriors, referred to as onna-bugeisha or "woman warrior. They fought alongside male samurai in battle and commonly used the naginata (a pole with a curved blade at the end).
                There were also samurai that were masterless and they were known as ronin samurai.
                The translation of ronin is "drifter" or "wanderer", a samurai became a ronin if their master died or their master took away their status.
                After a military government was established in 1192, samurai went on to rule Japan for roughly 700 years. The feudal era ended in 1868 and a few years later samurai were abolished.

            <p>The common appearance of a samurai was a full suit of flexible armor. This varied but samurai donned 2 weapons "during the Edo period (1600-1868) 
                the long katana sword and shorter companion sword known as a wakizashi were most commonly worn"(1). Different samurai carried different weapons with them.
                Some carried bow and arrows, spears, guns, but the primary weapon was the katana. 
                Samurai were known to be strong warriors. Samurai were said to use the jiujitsu fighting style. 
                They developed it during the era where they were not legally allowed to use weapons. 
                "jujitsu was to use an opponent's strength against him by employing handholds and deft maneuvers to throw the opponent off balance." (2)
                Jiujitsu is a fighting style that is still taught and used today.
                 When training the style of kendo was used. Kendo is the sword practice using bamboo swords.
            </p>
            <p>During the Tokugawa era samurai were in the upper caste of Japanese society. samurai were respected everywhere they went, due to the fact that disrespect could get you killed.
                If they were given any reason samurai could kill somebody if they got of line. That is what having the favor
                of the daimyo gave them.
            </p>

            <p>Samurai were commonly known to practice Buddhism. The principles of buddhism helped steel them for battle 
                and helped keep their minds focused. Samurai face death each day so the practice of Buddhism helped them become better 
            warriors and people. </p>
