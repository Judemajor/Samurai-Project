    <h1 class="heading">Samurai</h1>
    <p>This website will cover samurais and their place in history. Samurai were warriors and were in the upper ranks of the military.
      <br> Samurai originated in Japan and emerged in the late 12th century. Samurai are no longer around today
    but, they were respected warriors that were known for their loyalty, strength, and unwavering bravery. </p>

    <p>Samurai were under the authority of the shogun and were of a hereditary social class that used force to enforce law and order.
      The people feared and respected the samurai for their strength and their status. 
      Feudalism and samurai would continue to shape Japanese society until the end of the samurai era. 
      The warriors were around for so long that their influence can be seen even in today's Japan. 
      There are those that have devoted their lives to the research and preservation of samurai.
    </p>
    <p>The era of the samurai was very chaotic. Over that time period a great amount of Japanese blood was shed.
      Even in service to the feudal lords samurai kept their honor. If a samurai lost their honor they had to commit seppuku, also known as hara-kiri, 
      ritual suicide that involved stabbing themselves in the stomach with a short sword. Samurai were always willing to die for their honor and fight to the very end.
      That alone speaks volumes to the strength of the people of Japan.
